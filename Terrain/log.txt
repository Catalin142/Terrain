11.01.2024 - Simple heightmap rendering, no lod no nothing.

18.01.2024 - Changed the map, divided the heightmap into chunks of 64x64 triangles and added different lods.
		   - To generate different lods I created multiple index buffers for the chunks.
		   - Added terrain texturing using a map to blend between textures.
		   - Needs lots of optimizations:
				- Generate position, uv, on the shader directly to decrease the data transfer overhead
				- Use a single vertex buffer for every chunk

		   - TODO:
				- Add CPU timing
				- Fix terrain cracks

20.01.2024 - Added instanced LOD
		   - Added CPU benchmark
		   - No more vertex buffer, pass offsets

		   - TODO:
				- Fix terrain cracks

21.01.2024 - Decrease lod level triangles count
		   - Added vulkan sampler object, one sample for multiple textures
		   - Increase map size
		   
		   - TODO:
				- Fix terrain cracks

02.02.2024 - Added array texture for faster texture sampling

		   - TODO:
				- Fix terrain cracks
